<h1>Free Flight Prediction</h1>
<br>
A system that shall predict good days and locations for cross country
free flying such as paragliding. The system is trained with past
weather
prediction data and flights
from online xc competitions. With current weather prediction data it
can then make predictoins about possible flights in areas it is trained
for.<br>
<br>
Flightpred in opesource software licensed under the GPL v 3. The
development files are on on <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flightpred">http://sourceforge.net/projects/flightpred</a>.
The
autohro reserves the righ to make it available under a dual license
for commercial use at a later time.<br>
<h4>Short description</h4>
To do so, we collect weather prediction data from the past, and match
them with the flights that were uploaded to online competitions. Using
these data, we train a self learning system. Training will be
done per flight area and values to predict. <br>
Finally, when we want to predict future flights,
we fetch the current weather predictions, feed them to the system and
create a ranking of which areas have the best xc potential for the
upcoming days. <br>
<h3>Input</h3>
<h4>Weather Data</h4>
Numerical weather prediction systems calculate various physical
parameters for a
vast number of points on a
longitude / latitude grid at various pressure levels
(altitudes). They do so by modeling certain physical
rules (gas equations) on the parameters of the adjacent grid points.
These values can
be <a
 href="http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/wesley/fast_downloading_grib.html">downloaded</a>
as <a
 href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Grib-Files-Explained">grib
files</a>. At the moment, we use data from the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Forecast_System">GFS model</a>
run by the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">noaa</a>, as it is easily
accessible. In the future, we might also want to look for
data from a high quality meso scale model.<br>
To train our system, we have to extract some meaningful features at
some grid positions that are sensible for the flight area for which we
want to train. We will have to evaluate how many grid points and
pressure steps are feasible.<br>
These features could be:<br>
<ul>
  <li>year&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> (performance of material and people is
slowly progressing)</small><br>
  </li>
  <li>day of year&nbsp;<small> (seasonal differences)</small><br>
  </li>
  <li>day of week<small>&nbsp; (weekends)</small><br>
  </li>
  <li>per selected grid point and altitude step:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>temperature or difference to the next step (more important for
thermals than the bare temperature [to be prooved])<br>
    </li>
    <li>wind speed</li>
    <li>altitude</li>
    <li>humidity</li>
  </ul>
  <li>separately calculated per grid point:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>average temperature gradient for the height range used during
flight (e.g. 1500 - 3500m)</li>
    <li>best and worst temperature gradient between pressure levels.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Preprocessed features could be of value:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>if isobars are convex or concave.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Actual Flights from the online competitions</h4>
The measures that we want to predict have to be known for the past. So,
we will calculate these measures from the flights on the online
competitions such as <a href="http://www.xcontest.org">xcontest.org</a>
or <a href="http://www.onlinecontest.org">onlinecontest.org</a>
possibly also from Leonardo or others. Xcontest.org have kindly
provided us with all the data required.<br>
The measures will be calculated (for the past) and predicted (for the
future) per flight area and could include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>maximum distance<br>
  </li>
  <li>average distance</li>
  <li>maximum duration</li>
  <li>average duration<br>
  </li>
  <li>number of flights</li>
  <li>number of pilots having the best flight of the season.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The self learning system</h4>
We use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support
vector
machine</a>
but may later also experiment with <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>,
other
machine
learning
algorithms
or with voting of multiple systems. The engines have to be pluggable to
easily
experiment with different systems.<br>
To evaluate good features sets (grid point
location, altitude, parameters, svm config) and optimize the parametes
of the algorithm and its kernel, we use <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithms">genetic/evolutionary
algorithms</a>.&nbsp; <br>
We generate one training sample per day for each value that we seek to
predict.
Each training sample consists of all the extracted features from the
weather predictions and the desired result.<br>
<h4>Platform</h4>
The main development is in C++ on linux, specifically debian based
systems such as <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">ubuntu</a> or <a
 href="http://linux.voyage.hk/">voyage.</a> The code is open so it
should be easy
to port to other platforms such as mac os x or Windows, but as the
system runs on a server and can be accessed from a browser from any
platform, there's not much point in porting the system. Especially
porting to Windows might
prove difficult, as some of the used libraries are not tested on that
operating system.<br>
<h4>Output</h4>
<h5>Website</h5>
The primary location to see the results is
<a href="http://flightpred.homelinux.org">http://flightpred.homelinux.org</a>&nbsp;
The
website displays the
calculated predictions as well as some internal infornmations and the
documentation you're reading. <br>
The table wit the forecasts looks something like this:<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2"

<h5><a name="data_interface">Data interface</a></h5>
There is also a small flightpred Android app in the market. It gets the
data form the server by means of the data interface. The desired format
can be encoded directly in the URL. Currently these formats are
supported:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://flightpred.homelinux.org/forecast.php?format=xml">http://flightpred.homelinux.org/forecast.php?format=xml</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://flightpred.homelinux.org/forecast.php?format=json">http://flightpred.homelinux.org/forecast.php?format=json</a></li>
</ul>
You can use this data as well in your application or to display on your
website as long as you mention the source : <a
 href="http://flightpred.homelinux.org">http://flightpred.homelinux.org</a><br>
You are not allowed to charge for that data unless with agreement of
the flightpred author.<br>
<h5>Feeds</h5>
In the future, it would be nice if email or
sms alerts could be configured for good xc days in areas of interest.<br>
Also, an rss feed that updates after every forecast run has completed.<br>
<br>
<h3>Current Status (alpha)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Got flight data for the past three years from http://xcontest.org
bundled as json files. (thanks)</li>
  <li>The people from http://onlinecontest.org have yet to decide if
they can provide their data.</li>
  <li>Imported the flights into the database.</li>
  <li>Downloading grib data from the GFS model. First downloading the
grib index, and then downloading only the parts of interest through
bundled http byte range requests. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Postponed usage of the wdb (weather database) for the moment, as
it was not easy to make deb packages for the target platforms.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Decoding the grib data using the grib_api library and insert into
the database.</li>
  <li>Currently, there are about 6.5 million records in the db for
central europe on the following altitude levels : surface, 850 mb, 700
mb and 500 mb. For each of the 63 grid point that makes a bit more than
100'000 samples. The sql dump has currently a size of about 650MB.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Using postgis with spatial indexes for the position data.</li>
  <li>Assign the flying sites from the flights to prediction sites, by
defining a reference location and a radius.</li>
  <li>The "c with classes" interface found in <a
 href="http://www.torch.ch">torch</a> was a bit
disapointing. Better alternatives seem to be <a
 href="http://dclib.sourceforge.net/ml.html">dlib</a> and <a
 href="http://www.terborg.net/research/kml/">kml</a>.</li>
  <li>Integrated the <a href="http://dclib.sourceforge.net/ml.html">SVM
from
dlib</a> in a modular fashion, so that plugging other ml
algorithms should be relatively easy.</li>
  <li>Defined a representatoin for feature sets, and defined an initial
default feature set per flying site.</li>
  <li>Parse the textual representatoin of the feature sets.</li>
  <li>Trained some support vector machines with a limited set of
samples.</li>
  <li>Downloaded current weather predictions and calculated the first
flight
predictions.</li>
  <li>Integrated with libevocosm to explore feature and parameter
spaces. Using only cloning with mutation for reproduction. Mutation
only on the svm and kernel parameters so far (mutation on the features
is planned).</li>
  <li>When running evolution, in the first new generation, also look
for the best solutions in other flying sites.</li>
  <li>Basic import/export of trained solutions for backup and transfer
between machines.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Started packaging. An alpha version is available in my
ppa:richi-paraeasy/ppa</li>
  <li>Mutation on the features for the evolutionary algorithm.</li>
  <li>Website with table and maps display as well as evolution
generations.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Created a command to clean the database from obsolete stuff.</li>
  <li>Created a data interface for use in mobile apps or other websites.</li>
  <li>Created an android app that only downloads the predicted values
and display the max_km.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Complete save and load for trained solutions including the
individual solutions from the evolutionary runs, for use on other
systems and
backup. Has to work across 32 and 64 bit mmachines.</li>
  <li>Calculate pre-processed features, especially the temperature
gradient values.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Download strategy for grib forecast data: Try most recent run, if
not awailable try older one, until successfull.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Evaluate different sources of grib data with a finer grid.</li>
  <li>Re evaluate usage of wdb.</li>
  <li>Make sure, the debian package works correctly for
uninstall/upgrade. Currently there is an issue with the wt configuration.</li>
  <li>Display a map for each day and synchronize the zoom and pan
(problem with google maps and overlays) on the website.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Display a map on the android app with the circles of the days in
different colors.</li>
  <li>Implement the json interface in the Android client to reduce data transmission. Or implement a YAML interface on both the server and the client.</li>
  <li>Somebody wants to make clients for iOS, Meego, Symbian or JavaME?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems faced:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the GFS grib data servers dropped certain byte ranges that
were requested. So I had to loop and request the missing parts untill I
had all the requested data. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The data sets I initially used for reanalysis and forecast were
randomly found on the internet without any documentation. I later found
out that one used a 2.5 degree grid, while the other had a 1 degree
grid. So I had to go look for some documentation on details about the
different data sets that are available. Also some data sets become
publicly available with a delay of 30 hours whild others only need 30
minutes. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The course of dimensionality: Training with 98 features for the
samples of a month took some seconds, for three months it took a minute
and for six month it took an hour. But I stopped the attempt to train
the system on all the samples of three years after having used 48 hours
of CPU time. So I will need to implement some partitioning to be able
to train on the full three years, which is clearly what I want.</li>
  <li>First I planned the web application to download the grib data for
the future and runt the forecast in real time. But as especially
downloading and feature extraction are too slow, the forecast is now
mainly done in advance. Thus the web client soley reads the forecasts
of interest from the database.</li>
  <li>Drawing circles on the google map is somewhat complicated: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The first attempt was to use a javascript library that works
well on static pages. But I faced the problem that the javascript
library was loaded before the googlemaps javascript. I couldn't find a
way to load them in the correct order. <br>
    </li>
    <li>The Second attempt was to use a regular polyline overlay as
used in the Wt::WGoogleMap widget. Using 50 steps is looked like a nice
circle. This solution worked well if there was only on map on the page,
but as soon as there were multiple, te overlay disapeared.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Debianizing a non trivial web application is harder than I
thought. I faces lots of small problems for which it was difficult to
find a good solution. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage of the flightpred system</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
If you only want to see the flight predictions, you don't need to
install anything, just browse to <a
 href="http://flightpred.homelinux.org">http://flightpred.homelinux.org</a><br>
You can install the flightpred system if you want to contribute to the
project or run your own server.<br>
On ubuntu it's as easy as this:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">sudo apt-add-repository
ppa:richi-paraeasy/ppa</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">sudo apt-get install flightpred</span><br>
Packages for debian lenny are available upon request.<br>
You can download the code from subversion at sourceforge.net. <br>
To compile a release build, you need CMake. Development is done wih
CodeBlocks.<br>
You will also need some additional libraries. The files in the script
directory will be of help in getting these libraries and
compile/debianize/install them. <br>
Also the scripts for setting up the database are in the scripts
directory.<br>
<h3>Train the system</h3>
To train the system, we have a program called flightpred_train. You can
use it as follows. You will have to proceed step by step as they rely
on the data from the previous steps.<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flightpred_train --get-flights</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-&gt;
Reads
the
json
files from the flights/xcontest_org directory. In
the future it shall download the flight data directly from the
competition server. But for now I was provided with some files. I shall
not distribute them. So if you want them, we can ask the people from
xcontest.org.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flightpred_train --register-area
--name Fiesch --position "N47.5 E8.75" --area-radius 5000&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-&gt;&nbsp;
Registers
the
flight
area
Fiesch at the given position, and assigns all
flights that started within the selected radius to it.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flightpred_train --get-weather
--start-date "2009-01-01" --end-date "2009-09-30"&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-&gt;
Downloads
selected
grib
data
from the GFS model around the registered flying sites. Downloading mor
data for the grid points closest to the sites and a bit less data for
grid points farther away.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flightpred_train
--evolove-population </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">--name
Fiesch </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">--start_date
"2009-08-01" --end_date "2009-08-31" --generations 50
--max-validation-time 10 </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>-&gt;
Explores the solution space for good a good algorithm with good
parameters and features. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flightpred_train --train --name
Fiesch </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">--start_date
"2009-08-01" --end_date "2009-08-31"&nbsp; </span>-&gt; Trains the
system for the given site using the best solution from the previous
evolutionary runs.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">flightpred_train
--get-future-weather --forecast --db-maintenance </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>-&gt; Downloads the weather
predictions for the upcoming days. Generates predictions results for
the upcoming days. Cleans the database from obsolete stuff.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The web client</h3>
The second program of the system is the web application flightpred_wt.
It is a web application server. If you connect to it with a browser at <a
 href="http://flightpred.homelinux.org">http://flightpred.homelinux.org</a>
.
You can see the actual predictions. For more details see the witty
documentation for the moment.<br>
The live system runs on an alix embedded board, so be patient. Twice a
day it downloads the weather forecast data and calculates flight
predictions. <br>
