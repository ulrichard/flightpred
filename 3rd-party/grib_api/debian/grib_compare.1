grib_compare - Compares the grib messages contained in two files.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Compares the grib messages contained in two files one by one in the same order.

All the keys are compared except those listed with the -b option and those that are specific 
of a different grib edition. Also data values are compared and are considered as different 
if their maximum absolute difference is greater than the absolute error, that by default is 0.000001. 
The value used by the absolute error can be set with te -e option.
