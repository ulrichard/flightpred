.SH NAME
grib_set - Sets key/value pairs in gribs.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets key/value pairs in the input grib file and writes
each message to the output_grib_file.
It fails when an error occurs (e.g. key not found).

.SH USAGE 
grib_set [options] grib_file grib_file ... output_grib_file

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-s\fR key[:{s/d/l}]=value,key[:{s/d/l}]=value,...	
Key/values to set.
For each key a string (key:s) or a double (key:d) or a long (key:l)
type can be defined. By default the native type is set.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR 	Repack data. Sometimes after setting some keys involving properties
of the packing algorithm a repacking of data is needed.
This repacking is performed setting this -r option.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR value	
Set all the data values to "value".
.TP
\fB\-p\fR key[:{s/d/l}],key[:{s/d/l}],...	
Declaration of keys to print.
For each key a string (key:s) or a double (key:d) or a long (key:l)
type can be requested. Default type is string.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR key[:{s/d/l}],key[:{s/d/l}],...	
As -p adding the declared keys to the default list.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR key[:{s/d/l}]=value,key[:{s/d/l}]=value,...	Where clause.
Set is only executed for grib messages matching all the key/value constraints.
If a grib message does not match the constraints it is copied unchanged
to the output_grib_file. This behaviour can be changed setting the option -S.
For each key a string (key:s) or a double (key:d) or a long (key:l)
type can be defined. Default type is string.
.TP
\fB\-7\fR 	Does not fail when the message has wrong length
.TP
\fB\-S\fR 	Strict. Only grib messages matching all the constraints are copied to
the output file
.TP
\fB\-V\fR 	Version.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR 	Multi-grib support off. Turn off support for multiple fields in single grib message
.TP
\fB\-g\fR 	Copy GTS header. 
.TP
\fB\-G\fR 	GRIBEX compatibility mode.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR 	Force. Force the execution not to fail on error.
